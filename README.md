# Movie Site Project

- The goal with this project was to create a movie site. A multi-page React application and use an API.

## Getting Started with the Project
- I started the project by sketching out how I wanted the movie site to look and figuring out what pages I needed. To make the site easy to navigate, I used React Router-dom and added Routes and NavLinks. One tricky part was getting information from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, but I managed it by using React's state management and the useEffect hook. 

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem
- To start this project, I used lessons to fetch movie info. For easy navigation, I used React Router, a tool helping create different pages and links. Plus, I used useParams to customize the user experience based on specific movie details. If I had troubled I googled and asked chat gpt
### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
