# Movie Site Project

- The goal with this project was to create a movie site. A multi-page React application and use an API.

## Getting Started with the Project
- I started the project by sketching out how I wanted the movie site to look and figuring out what pages I needed. To make the site easy to navigate, I used React Router-dom and added Routes and NavLinks. One tricky part was getting information from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, but I managed it by using React's state management and the useEffect hook. 

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem
- To start this project, I used lessons to fetch movie info. For easy navigation, I used React Router, a tool helping create different pages and links. Plus, I used useParams to customize the user experience based on specific movie details. If I had troubled I googled and asked chat gpt
